    - Blocks Templates and Layouts
    - '"1) To create a block that has dynamic PHP code and place it anywhere on your
      site, you first must instantiate the block in app/design/frontend/ThemePackage/Theme/layout/local.xml
      and put the following contents:\n\n\r &nbsp;\r\n\n\\<?xml version=\"1.0\"?\\>\n\n\\<layout
      version=\"0.0.1\"\\>\n\n\\<default\\>\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \\<reference name=\"left\"\\>\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      the value of Reference Name to wherever you want the code to appear on your
      site (for examples of what to put as a value, look in some of the magento files
      in app/design/frontend/base/default/layout/ !!)\n\n\r &nbsp;\r\n\n2) Create
      a template file in app/design/frontend/base/default/template/Package/Module/template.phtml
      and put some HTML code into it. Boom! Now the code from your PHTML file appears
      wherever you specified it in your reference name tag in the layout file we first
      created!\n\n\r &nbsp;\r\n\n3) To use Dynamic PHP Code \\*\\* FINISH\n\n\r &nbsp;"'

    - PHPStorm Xdebug running on MAMP on Yosemite
    - '"Xdebug has proven to be one of the hardest things to get running on any IDE.
      I have had an exceptionally hard time getting it running on MAMP server running
      on Yosemite. Here is my solution:\r \r - Make sure you have MAMP, Homebrew and
      Yosemite\r \r Make sure you have tapped thome Homebrew Repositories:\r \r brew
      tap homebrew/dupes\r brew tap homebrew/versions\r brew tap homebrew/homebrew-php\r
      brew tap homebrew/homebrew-binary\r \r Next install PHP 5.6 with the php-cgi
      module. I was running into a very popular bug about not having php-cgi installed.
      I have the latest MAMP server, running PHP 5.5, and I wanted to keep my MySQL
      local server running as-is to keep my many databases and the environment intact
      (because I have already wasted enough time getting xdebug to run).\r \r brew
      install php56 --without-snmp --with-cgi --with-debug --with-homebrew-openssl
      --with-imap --with-intl --with-mysql\r \r Then install xdebug\r \r brew install
      php56-xdebug\r \r Next, find out which httpd.conf file you are using by doing
      the following command. NOTE: This did not work for me, this produced a false
      positive and I actually had to find my MAMP httpd.conf file in a different location:\r
      \r ps aux | grep httpd - This will display the PHP file running. Ex: /Applications/MAMP/Library/bin/httpd
      - Navigate to the folder containing the httpd file and run httpd -V | grep .conf
      to see what Config file it is using\r \r This did not work for me - I instead
      found my working httpd.conf file in:\r \r /Applications/MAMP/conf/apache/httpd.conf\r
      \r Add the line:\r \r LoadModule php5\\_module /usr/local/opt/php56/libexec/apache2/libphp5.so\r
      \r This will load the new PHP 5.6 as the PHP version for the MAMP server. Restart
      the server, open up PHP Storm and open Prefs \\> Languages \\> PHP \\> Interpreter
      \\> Click ... and Add a new Interpreter. Set the new PHP home to the new PHP
      5.6 installed with homebrew:\r \r /usr/local/Cellar/php56/5.6.4/bin\n\n"'

    - Using jQuery in Magento Modules
    - '"1) First download Jquery and place it in the base directory of magento in
      the JS folder (magento/js.)\n\n2) Next, add the following line to the header.html
      file in app/design/frontend/ThemePackage/Theme/template/page/head.phtml&nbsp;-\n\n`\r\n\r\n<script
      type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.4/jquery.min.js\"></script>\r\n\r\n<script
      type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n$.noConflict();\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n`\r \r place
      it below the line that says:\r \r`\r\n\r\n<?php echo $this->getCssJsHtml() ?>\r\n\r\n</code> \r\n\r\n3)
      Check to see if Jquery is being loaded using and if the DOM works:\r\n\r\n<script>\r\n\r\nif(document.getElementById(''year'')){
      } else {\r\ndocument.write(\"DOM NOT Supported\");\r\n}\r\n\r\nif(typeof jQuery
      === ''undefined''){\r\ndocument.write(\"<h2>Jquery NOT Loaded</h2>\");\r\n}\r\n\r\n</script>\r\n4)
       You want to load the event listeners when the page loads, so:\r\n<code>\r\nwindow.onload
      = init;\r\nfunction init(){\r\n\r\nvar year = document.getElementById(''year'');\r\n\r\nyear.onchange
      = selectYear;\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\n`;\r \r &nbsp;\r \r 5) You are going to want to
      make a route that leads to an action so you can use AJAX to return parameters
      through the Magento system:\r \r`\r\n\r\npublic function getmakeAction(){\r\n\r\n$year
      = '''';\r\n\r\nforeach ($this->getRequest()->getParams() as $key => $value){\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nand
      the AJAX:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n\r\nfunction selectYear() {\r\n\r\nvar year_selected
      = year.value;\r\n\r\nvar ajax;\r\n\r\najax = new XMLHttpRequest();\r\n\r\nif(ajax){
      } else {\r\ndocument.write(\"<h2>Ajax HTTP Request Object is not loading properly</h2>\");\r\n}\r\n\r\najax.open(''get'',
      ''/interchange/search/getmake?year='' + encodeURIComponent(year_selected));\r\n\r\najax.onreadystatechange
      = function() {\r\nhandleResponse(ajax);\r\n};\r\n\r\najax.send(null);\r\n\r\nreturn
      false;\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction handleResponse(ajax){\r\n\r\nif(ajax.readyState
      == 4){\r\n\r\nif((ajax.status == 200) || (ajax.status == 304)){\r\n\r\nvar make
      = document.getElementById(''make'');\r\n\r\nmake.innerHTML = ajax.responseText;\r\n\r\nmake.disabled
      = false;\r\n\r\nresults.style.display = ''block'';\r\n\r\n} else {\r\nalert(\"Error
      in AJAX Response!\");\r\n}\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\n`\r \r Enjoy!"'

    - NoSQL comparison Amazon's DynamoDB Vs MongoDB Vs Oracle for database Logging

      it could be replacing your Oracle or MySQL server before you know it! You can

      is going to handle will be enormous, because&nbsp;each copy of our software

      DynamoDB&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>\n\n#### Traditional Database Problems (What DynamoDB
      solves)\n\n- Traditional databases find it hard to maintain acceptable data
      speeds because many databases were not designed to handle large scale software\n-
      As more and more simultaneous LIMS + ELN Instances write & access our Logging
      Database, the database layer will slow down and can possibly fail\n- Traditional
      solution: build a large distributed database cluster or partition data over
      multiple instances as you scale - this is hard and expensive to build + maintain
      (and continually grow) and this will require a lot of expertise.\n- Database
      may also may reach a point where the maximum amount of data may exceed the maximum
      amount of data allowed in cluster\n- Big problems: Too much data to handle quickly
      (or even possibly), patching and upgrading DB software in DB clusters without
      any downtime\n\n**DynamoDB''s Solution**\n\n- High performance, non-relational
      database service developed for the cloud\n- Created from the ground up specifically
      for large scale applications to offer low latency (server side latency is typically
      1-9 milliseconds) and high throughput database service\n- Runs on solid state
      drives, built to maintain consistent fast latencies at any scale\n- DynamoDB
      is a service, not a software\n- Simply tell the service how many requests you
      would like it to be able to handle per second and it scales itself automatically\n-
      When you need more data connections per second, simply update the request capacity
      in the AWS management console or using the API. The previous throughput level
      is available while scaling (no downtime).\n- Amazon''s DynamoDB solution is
      very reliable: the data is replicated across multiple AWS availability zones
      for maximum up-time + synchronous data replication protects any individual node\n\n**About
      DynamoDB**\n\n- Dynamo DB is schema-less (except for the required primary key)\n-
      Individual items in a DynamoDB table can have any number of attributes.\n- A
      database is a collection of tables, a table is a collection of items and each
      item is a collection of attributes\n- _Individual&nbsp;items in a table can
      have any number of attributes, but there is a limit of 64KB on the item size.
      Item size is the sum of lengths of its attributes names and values (binary and
      uf-8 lengths)_\n- _Each attribute in an item is a name-value pair and an&nbsp;attribute&nbsp;can
      be single valued or a multi-valued set, no duplicates allowed. DynamoDB&nbsp;doesn''t&nbsp;allow&nbsp;null
      or empty string attribute values. The ID is the only required attribute.,_\n\n**DynamoDB
      Primary Key&nbsp;**<sup>2</sup>\n\n- Hash type primary key - the primary key
      is made of one attribute, a hash attribute. The DB builds an un-ordered hash
      index on this primary key attribute\n- Hash and range type primary key - in
      this case the primary key is made of two attributes: the first is a hash attribute
      and the second is a range attribute. DB builds an un-ordered hash index on the
      has primary key attribute and a sorted range index on the range primary key
      attribute. Example, a forum DB setup:\r ![](https://corelims.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/20840572/image2014-7-23%2010%3A9%3A17.png?version=1&modificationDate=1406124556603&api=v2
      \"Core Product Development > Database Logging > image2014-7-23 10:9:17.png\")\n\n**DynamoDB
      Data Types**\n\n**Scalar data types -&nbsp;**number, string, binary\n\n**Multi-valued
      data types -**&nbsp;String set, Number set, Binary set\n\n**Item Operations**-
      the&nbsp;_UpdateItem_&nbsp;operation allows you to update existing attribute
      values, add new attributes, and delete existing attributes from an item. You
      can also preform conditional updates, Example: so the update will only happen
      if the current price is $20.\n\n**Notable DynamoDB Documented Limits Vs. MongoDB&nbsp;**<sup>1</sup><sup>,
      2</sup>\n\n- Table Size: No practical limit in number of bytes or items.&nbsp;**VS**&nbsp;_MongoDB''s
      maximum number of collections (tables) in a DB is a function of the size of
      the namespace file and the number of indexes of collections in the database_\n-
      Hash or hash-and-range primary key:&nbsp;Number of hash key values - No practical
      limit.\n- Hash-and-range primary key: Number&nbsp;of range keys per hash value
      - No practical limit for tables without local secondary indexes\n- Attribute
      name lengths - cannot exceed 255 bytes.&nbsp;**VS**&nbsp;_MongoDB namespaces
      (including databases and collection (table) names cannot exceed 123bytes)_\n-
      Item (row) size - cannot exceed 65kb, Attribute names count against a attribute
      name binary length and attribute value lengths.&nbsp;**VS**&nbsp;_MongoDB document
      size limit is 16 megabytes and no more than 100 levels of nesting documents_\n-
      Maximum concurrent Control Plane API requests (creating, updating or deleting)
      - Up to 10 of these requests running concurrently \\*\\* This may be a game-changer
      because our centralized logging server would need way more than 10 concurrent
      API connections.\n\n**DynamoDB Vs. MongoDB**&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>\n\n- With DynamoDB
      you are not able to alter indexing after its been created, without creating
      a new table and migrating the data.\n- Use MongoDB if you require the features
      of a document database; DynamoDB is key-value based and supports search of just
      a value or set, no sub-document supported and no complex index and query is
      supported.\n- DynamoDB item (row) size limit is 65kb, MongoDB does not have
      this limitation.\n- Use MongoDB if you need any other data types other than
      string, number and base64 encoded binary\n- Use MongoDB is you are going to
      query by regular expression\n- Use DynamoDB if integrating with other AWS''s\n\n**DynamoDB&nbsp;****Connection**\n\n-
      AWS SDK is recommended for connection, rather than making requests to DynamoDB
      API directly from application\n- The SDK handle authentication ,serialization
      and connection management\n- Direct API access requires construction of individual
      JSON service requests; containing JSON payload, HTTP headers and a valid AWS
      signature\n- JSON is just for data transport, the data is not stored on disk
      in JSON format (MongoDB is stored this way)\n\n**_Additional Reading_**\n\n&nbsp;[http://info.mongodb.com/rs/mongodb/images/10gen\\_Top\\_5\\_NoSQL\\_Considerations.pdf](http://info.mongodb.com/rs/mongodb/images/10gen_Top_5_NoSQL_Considerations.pdf)\n\n####
      Note on async wrapper\n\nThe async wrapper will decrease the time to almost
      nothing on any of the appenders, but doesn''t represent the true performance
      of your logger. It only delegates the process of logging to a different thread
      so it can continue its own process without having to wait for the log to be
      written and committed. That is&nbsp;**extremely**&nbsp;useful in practice, but
      it does nothing for our comparison, because we want to compare the actual speed
      of each process so we can find out how long our resources (CPU, mem, etc) is
      being taken up just for logging.\n\nAlso note that the async wrapper has a buffer,
      so the longer it takes to actually log something, the longer the object will
      stay in the buffer and if we hit the buffer limit, things will start slowing
      down because it will start waiting for the buffer to clear before it can add
      more things to it. There is a setting to NOT block when the buffer is full,
      but it means that you will lose all data that doesn''t fit in the buffer.\n\nLastly,
      if the main thread is killed (i.e. Tomcat is shut down or killed) and there
      are still things in the buffer, all that information will be lost.\n\n# References\n\n1

    - Splunk Database app Bug
    - '"When trying to ues the Splunk DB Connect App, to attempt to connect to my
      Oracle DB in splunk, I was getting the following error.\r \r Error: Encountered
      the following error while trying to update: In handler ''localapps'': Error
      while posting to url=/servicesNS/nobody/dbx/dbx/install/java\r \r I found another
      person in the Splunk \"Answers\" forum and nobody answered either of us, so
      I dug deep into the logs and found the problem.\r \r The problem is, that Splunk
      is looking in Program Files/Java/Jre7/bin/ for a folder in bin called server
      containing a a jvm.dll - the server folder nor the jvm.dll did not exist.\r
      \r After alot of searching (and re installing Java with no avail) I discovered
      jvm.dll in Program Files/Java/Jre7/bin/client - so what you need to do to fix
      this random Java error when adding a database in the DB app in Splunk is: copy
      the client folder in jre7/bin and rename it to server and place it in jre7/bin
      - make sure it contains jvm.dll and boom your all set. Restart Splunk and everything
      will work fine.\r \r Also, you are going to need the Oracle JDBC driver, I used
      this one:\r \r http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/enterprise-edition/jdbc-111060-084321.html\r
      \r And download \"objdbc6.jar\" and place it in Program Files / Splunk / etc

    - Java SE 1.8 EE Incorrect Access Restrictions for JavaFX jfxrt.jar
    - '"In Java 8 (JavaSE-1.8 EE) / JavaFX there is a bug in Eclipse that gives a
      false Access Restriction warning for any reference to the JavaFX jfxrt.jar class.
      A hurdle for most of the suggested solutions to this problem was that we are
      using Maven, so any project configuration files were generated by m2e and are
      overwritten whenever the POM files are changed. Our prioject includes multi-module
      maven builds with over 20+ individual projects.\n\n```\nAccess restriction:
      The constructor CheckBox(String) is not accessible due to restriction on required

      \r This has not properly been fixed, but in the meantime, the solution we are
      using at Apelon for this bug is as follows:\r \r To implement this fix, you
      must unzip the org.eclipse.osgi JAR, then modify the /org.eclipse.osgi/JavaSE-1.8.profile
      and change the first property to the values below.\r \r The JAR file is commonly
      located in these locations (the numbers and letters are the end of the file

      Unpackage the jar (I used WinZip on windows, and Ez7z on my Macbook at home)\r
      \r Edit the JavaSE-1.8.properties file with a text editor (I used Notepad++),

      Winzip, and place it back in the plugins directory. But after re-packaging the
      JAR, I had to open it in WinZip (just to view the contents of the JAR zipped)
      to verify that the folder structure reflected that of the original JAR file

      I said, this error came as a result of my \"hacking\" a JAR file (as a work-around
      for a JavaFX bug(. Java 8 and JavaFX are very new technologies; both are great
      updates for Java, and FX is an awesome replacement for the Swing framework,
      but (as always) with new technology comes new bugs. And this is one of them.\n\nThis
      error came as a result of me modifying the org.eclipse.osgi JAR''s JavaSE-1.8.properties
      file. You may also have some problems with the signatures in the JAR as well.
      Read the comment for further instructions on how to fix the signature issues
      that may arise from hacking the JAR.\n\n**To simply remedy this problem:** grab
      a fresh download of Eclipse, and replace the modified JAR with a fresh copy
      from a new Eclipse download. By replacing your modified JAR with a fresh un-modified
      copy from the Eclipse Download, you will know whether or not that JAR was the
      problem.\n\n**Make sure to check the folder structure of the JAR that you suspect
      is causing problems to see if maybe WinZip created some weird folder structure
      when zipping up the folder back into a JAR.** This happened to me many times
      and Dan had to help me figure out that Winzip was creating some weird folder
      structure.\n\n**Also, I was initially using the JAR command in CLI to package
      the JAR file, but this was also giving me folder structure problems. I would
      not recommend using the JAR command to package JARs actually**. Dan suggested
      that I just use a zip program to zip the file and then simply change the extension
      to .jar (Dan does not recommend WinZip, I used it because I don''t have time
      to grab another right now). After enabling file extensions to be displayed in
      Windows Explorer Prefs (Windows Computers make everything so complicated :)
      )).\n\n**If this did not fix your problem:** then try figuring out which JAR
      is giving you a problem from the error log and try replacing with with a fresh
      copy from a new Eclipse download.\n\n\r \r That''s all!\r \r Cheers"'

    - Maven Mojo's
    - '"**Full Project:** [https://github.com/vaskaloidis/maven-example](https://github.com/vaskaloidis/maven-example)\r
      \r So today I was tasked with learning about Mojo''s and making my first \"Hello
      World\" program with Maven! Jesse, Informatics Engineer at Apelon, pulled me
      off of development of our latest ISAAC feature, Mapping, and told me to write
      the Hello World App, below is a guide. Here is a link to the whole project (2
      of them in 1 repository) on GitHub.\r \r https://github.com/vaskaloidis/maven-example\r
      \r In Eclipse, crate a new Maven Project. You will be making two projects, I
      named my projects: vas and vasSecond. \r \r Let''s create the first project.
      This project is the Maven Mojo. The other project executes this mojo.\r\n```\nNew
      > Other > Maven > Maven Project\n```\n\r \r You will need to give your Maven
      Project a Group ID (Apelon), and an ArtifactID (vas), and a version (1.0-SNAPSHOT).\r
      \r A new file should have been created called App, open it and do something
      like this:\r\n```\npackage apelon.vas;\r\n\r\nimport org.apache.maven.plugin.AbstractMojo;\r\nimport
      org.apache.maven.plugin.MojoExecutionException;\r\nimport org.apache.maven.plugins.annotations.Mojo;\r\nimport
      org.apache.maven.plugins.annotations.Parameter;\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * A Mojo that
      says hi\r\n */\r\n@Mojo( name = \"sayhi\")\r\npublic class App extends AbstractMojo\r\n{\r\n    @Parameter
      ( property = \"greeting\")\r\n    private String greeting;\r\n\t\r\n    public
      void execute() throws MojoExecutionException \r\n    {\r\n    \tgetLog().info(greeting
      + \" -Vas\");\r\n    \tSystem.out.println(greeting + \" -Vas (CLI)\");\r\n    }\r\n}\n```\n\r
      \r Here you are adding a Maven annotation so we can reference this Java class
      from the POM file. We are also annotating a string, which allows us to pass
      in data from the POM file to be used in the Java class. \r \r You will probably
      be getting an error about the org.apache dependency not being found. Ignore
      that for now because it will be fixed once we create your Maven file. This simply
      creates a new Goal that prints out \"Hello, World -Vas\" when run.\r \r Now
      open your POM, and make it look like this.\r \r<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/vaskaloidis/507c1b800fc0933054d4.js\"></script>\r
      \r Here we are adding the basics to our project, the Group ID, the artifact,
      the verison and the packaging, which should have already been filled out by
      Eclipse when it created your project. You are also identifying your build plugins
      for when you build your project. You are adding 3 dependencies that your project
      needs (one should fix your dependency problem). The other dependencies are for
      jUnit (Unit testing) and the other is for the annotations we added in the App.java
      file\r \r Now do a Maven Install in the project folder in the Command Line:\r\n```\nmvn
      clean install\n```\n\r \r Now if you go to command line and try to run it, it
      should print back \"Hello, World -Vas\". \r\n```\nmvn apelon:vas:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT:sayhi\n```\n\r
      \r We are going to take this one step further and create another Maven project
      that will execute this Mojo during a specified lifecycle phase.\r \r\n```\nNew
      > Other > Maven > Maven Project\n```\n\r \r Now open that POM and add this to
      your build section:\r \r<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/vaskaloidis/b048bf6fbf216156052f.js\"></script>\r
      \r This executes the sayhi goal from the first project. You must run a maven
      install on the first project before this will work. This will also pass in the
      string called Greeting that it set to \"Hello Apelon World\", and the Java class
      execute will print that to the command line upon execution. To run this second
      POM so that it executes the first project''s Mojo, you navigate to the second
      project''s main folder and run this command (or any command)\r\n```\nmvn clean
      package\n```\n\r \r This will execute the execute method from the first project.
      You have now made your first Maven Mojo!\r \r \r Cheers"'

    - Launch Ubuntu Compiz Expose (Scale) Effect from Launcher Icon + Command-Line
    - '"So &nbsp;I have&nbsp;wanted&nbsp;to research&nbsp;+ configure&nbsp;this for
      a while now... I wanted the ability to execute the Compiz \"Expose\" (aka the
      \"Scale-Effect\")&nbsp; from the command-line + the Ubuntu Dock (aka the&nbsp;Launcher)...
      I found a nice Stack Overflow answer (link below), and learned how. Check it
      out:\r \r First,&nbsp;set the \"Scale\" Compiz Effect hotkey&nbsp;to Super+W
      or any other key-combo&nbsp;you want - but for this example we use Super+W -&nbsp;so
      you can swap this out for your key-combo accordingly. First, we install xdo-tool
      to simulate keystroke-combos in the console:\n\n```\nsudo apt-get install xdo-tool\n```\n\r
      Then make a script called ''/usr/local/bin/compiz-scale.sh'' and make it executable.\r\n```\n#!
      /bin/sh\r\n# Assumes compiz binding for Initiate Window Picker is set to key-binding
      \"Super+W\"\r\nxdotool key Super+w\n```\n\r Then create the desktop entry.\r\n```\n#
      Use Sublime Text 3 if you have it, or substitute subl with gedit\r\nsudo subl
      /usr/share/applications/compzi-scale.desktop\r\n\r\n#!/usr/bin/env xdg-open\r\n#
      link me to /usr/share/applications/\r\n\r\n[Desktop Entry]\r\nComment=Switch
      programs\r\nExec=/usr/local/bin/compiz-scale.sh\r\nIcon=gnome-klotski\r\nName=Scale\r\nTerminal=false\r\nType=Application\r\nVersion=1.0\r\n\r\n#Link
      this desktop file to a newly created link in the Launcher folder\r\nsudo ln
      -s /usr/local/bin/compiz-scale.sh /usr/share/applications/compiz-scale.desktop\n```\n\r
      Now search for \"scale\" and drag the file to the Dock. Click the icon to execute
      the Scale Compiz Command.\r \r You can read the whole answer [here, on Stack
      Overflow](http://askubuntu.com/questions/33852/can-unity-display-a-launcher-icon-for-spread-mode/39775#39775).\r

      function. Each building face has a normal, so the spotlight lighting feature
      could be used. The buildings are all different Textures, all different combinations
