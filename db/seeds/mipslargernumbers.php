        <h2>MIPS Single Precision Floating Point Unit Array of User Input</h2>

        <p>This program takes user input of floating point unit numbers, up to ten numbers and stores them in an FPU array. Once the user enters a negative number, the program will loop through the FPU array and print the numbers that are greater than the last numbered entered before the negative sentinel. Or if the user inputs ten numbers, the program will then loop through and print the FPU array values that are greater than the previous number</p>
